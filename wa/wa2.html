        <p> My name is <strong>Autumn Davis</strong> (yes, like the season), and I use she/they pronouns.  I am brand new to coding and am taking Comp Foundations at the same time, so I am looking to apply my learnings to make cool projects. I want to use this class as a way to learn if I have interest in pursuing web design.</p>
